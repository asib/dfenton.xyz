# Misc entries

Add `public/misc/<slug>/diagram.html`, a preview image, and `meta.json`. The folder name is the URL slug (lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens), and the page is served at `/misc/<slug>/`.

```json
{
  "title": "Two surfaces, one cutting edge",
  "description": "An interactive exploration of how two surfaces meet to form a cutting edge.",
  "date": "2026-10-18",
  "preview": "preview.webp",
  "previewDark": "preview-dark.webp"
}
```

The Misc page at `/misc/` discovers metadata at build time and lists entries newest first. No registry needs editing. Commit and push to publish through the existing Cloudflare Pages deployment.

Each diagram.html is a standalone document. Keep local assets in its folder and use relative paths. The shared React page provides the title, navigation, and theme toggle. Preserve the sandbox when importing a Codex visualization export. Check mobile layout, light/dark appearance, and controls in an ordinary browser; exports may depend on external CDNs.

The homepage links to `/misc/`. Entry URLs render through the same React shell (Cloudflare Pages SPA fallback), which embeds `diagram.html`. The visualization accepts a `site-theme` message from its same-origin parent and forwards it into the sandbox without resetting interaction state. Its colors and typography use the homepage palette in both themes.

Each list entry includes a small static preview. `preview` is a required image filename in the entry folder (SVG, PNG, WebP, or JPEG); optional `previewDark` selects a separate image when the site’s dark theme is active. Use a representative diagram snapshot, with fine labels removed if they would be unreadable at thumbnail size. The list supplies an accessible title, so preview images use empty alt text. Avoid live iframes in the list.
